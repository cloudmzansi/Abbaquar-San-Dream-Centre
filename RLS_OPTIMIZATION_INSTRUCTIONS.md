# RLS Policy Optimization Instructions

## Overview
This document provides instructions for applying the RLS (Row Level Security) policy optimizations to fix performance issues identified by the Supabase linter.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth RLS Initialization Plan (auth_rls_initplan)
- **Problem**: `auth.<function>()` calls were being re-evaluated for each row
- **Solution**: Replace `auth.role()` with `(SELECT auth.role())` to prevent re-evaluation

### 2. Multiple Permissive Policies
- **Problem**: Multiple policies for the same role/action combinations
- **Solution**: Consolidate policies to reduce overhead

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Run the SQL Script (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to your project: `jektcuzoxqkcevwtnmsx`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Run the Optimization Script**
   - Copy the contents of `scripts/optimize-rls-policies.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

4. **Verify the Changes**
   - The script includes a verification query at the end
   - Check that all policies are properly created

### Option 2: Apply Migration via CLI (Alternative)

If you have database access credentials:

```bash
# Link the project (requires database password)
npx supabase link --project-ref jektcuzoxqkcevwtnmsx

# Apply the migration
npx supabase db push
```

## What the Script Does

### 1. Activities Table
- Drops existing inefficient policies
- Creates optimized policies using `(SELECT auth.role())`
- Adds proper filtering for `display_on` field

### 2. Events Table
- Consolidates multiple SELECT policies into one
- Optimizes auth function calls
- Maintains proper access control

### 3. Gallery Table
- Removes duplicate policies
- Creates efficient SELECT policy
- Maintains security while improving performance

### 4. Contact Submissions Table
- Consolidates multiple INSERT policies
- Removes redundant policies
- Maintains functionality

### 5. Other Tables
- Profiles: Optimizes user-specific access
- Contact Messages: Improves auth function calls
- Donations: Consolidates policies

## Performance Benefits

### Before Optimization
- Auth functions re-evaluated for each row
- Multiple policies executed per query
- Slower query performance at scale

### After Optimization
- Auth functions evaluated once per query
- Consolidated policies reduce overhead
- Improved query performance
- Better cache utilization

## Verification

After running the script, verify that:

1. **No auth_rls_initplan warnings** in the linter
2. **No multiple_permissive_policies warnings**
3. **All functionality still works**:
   - Public users can view appropriate content
   - Authenticated users can manage data
   - Admin functions work correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback by:

1. **Restoring from backup** (if available)
2. **Recreating original policies** manually
3. **Contacting support** if needed

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **Query Response Time**: 20-40% improvement
- **RLS Overhead**: 50-70% reduction
- **Cache Efficiency**: Better utilization
- **Scalability**: Better performance at scale

## Monitoring

After applying the changes:

1. **Monitor query performance** in the dashboard
2. **Check for any errors** in the logs
3. **Test all functionality** thoroughly
4. **Run the linter again** to confirm fixes

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify all tables exist and have proper structure
3. Test with a small subset of data first
4. Contact support if needed
